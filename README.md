# Breadbot

Breadbot is an Arduino Uno powered bread proofer and data logger.

## Overview

- It uses a [thermistor to sense the temperature][1].
- [When the temperature is below 27°C (80°F), a relay connects power from the wall outlet][3] to a [clamp light][7] which is fitted with an incandescent globe. This provides enough heat keep the inside of an oven at 27°C.
- One [button cycles through the stages of making bread][5]: Pre-Ferment, Autolyse, Bulk Ferment, Bench Rest, Proofing
- The other button starts and stops a timer. [And this is all logged to an SD card as a CSV file.][4]
- [A 2x16 LCD screen][2] shows the current temperature, the target temperature, breadmaking stage and time if logging is on.

## Parts

- [This starter kit][6] includes an Arduino Uno, breadboard, thermistor, LCD screen, plus a whole bunch of wires, resistors etc. that you might need.
- A [clamp light][7] is a cheap lamp to use but I want to try using this [heating element][8] as it's 200W and would probably do just as well as an incandescent globe with less bulk.
- The relay that comes in the kit isn't mounted on the board and I had all kinds of trouble with it. So I got [this one][14].
- You need a [Micro SD Card Module][10] that does level shifting. The first one I bought didn't do this and I fried a card and had a few hours of frustration. Get a [lower capacity Micro SD card][9] (I think 32gb is the max). This needs to be formatted in either FAT16 or FAT32. It's recommended that you do it with the [SD Association SD Card Formatter][12].
- I put it all inside a [Pelican Case][11] which I drilled holes in for power access and for the SD Card Module and buttons to be mounted on the outside of the case. I needed to get a smaller breadboard to fit inside this size case. I used the one from [this kit][15], which was worth buying because it included another Ardiuno Uno.
- I think I'll replace the buttons I have with [these more robust buttons][13]. I don't want the wires to disconnect in 6 months and have to work out how to wire it again.

I spent a touch under $100 but you could do it for $80 or less. Rather than buying the kit you could get an Arduino, wires, resistors and thermistor individually.
